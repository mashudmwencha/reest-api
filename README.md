--This is a django rest framework project with django as the backend and hopefully react as the frontend --

to run the project one needs to have visual studio code or whichever editor one prefers 
clone the project and open it on visual studio
on the terminal install django 
next install a virtual environment using pipenv then activate the virtual environment using pipenv shell
install djangorestframework and django-cors-headers
run the project on the terminal using the command python manage.py runserver
then navigate to the api page coz there was no webpage created to display the GET request 
you can now view the endpoints of the django rest framework created and the details as added in the database
..the project is still under development in the addition of the frontend bit
